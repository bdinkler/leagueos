# LeagueOS Design System

This document describes the design language for LeagueOS. The primary visual reference is the palette image we use for LeagueOS.

## Colors (Conceptual)

- Primary: Vibrant accent color used for main CTAs and highlights.
- Secondary / Surface: Darker background for cards and headers.
- Background: Light neutral for app backgrounds.
- Text Primary: High-contrast dark text.
- Text Secondary: Muted gray text.
- Accent: Warm highlight color for status, chips, and key icons.
- Danger: Red for destructive actions and errors.
- Success: Green for confirmations.

## Components

- Cards with soft rounded corners and subtle shadows.
- Primary buttons with filled style; secondary buttons with outline.
- Tags/badges for keeper types (Rookie, Waiver, FT) using distinct accent colors.
- Consistent spacing (8px base unit).
- Clear typographic hierarchy for titles, subtitles, and body text.

Use this together with `/shared/ui/theme.ts` (once created) so all screens share the same look and feel.
